Condensa Lite Documentation
===========================

Condensa Lite is a framework for **programmable model compression** in Python.
It comes with a set of built-in compression operators which may be used to
compose complex compression schemes targeting specific combinations of DNN,
hardware platform, and optimization objective.
Common programming abstractions such as conditionals, iteration, and
recursion are all natively supported.
Accuracy recovery after pruning is currently supported via learning rate 
rewinding.

Condensa Lite is under active development, and bug reports, pull requests, and other feedback are all highly appreciated.
